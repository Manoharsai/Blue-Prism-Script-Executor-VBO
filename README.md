# Script Executor VBO

This asset is designed to assist in the execution of a script and return its results to Blue Prism. This VBO compliments and extends the information provided in the [Code Stages document](https://blueprism.developerprogram.org/site/global/developer/integration/index.gsp) provided on the Blue Prism Digital Exchange Developer Area.

Initially, the asset is intended for Python, as we have received a number of requests for assistance in working with Python scripts. This asset will work with NodeJS also. In fact there is no reason that it shouldn't work with any scripting engine that has a runtime that you can locate using the file explorer on your computer. If in any doubt, ask.
